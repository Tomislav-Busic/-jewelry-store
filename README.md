After creating several pages with html, css, javascript and practicing the same with ReactJS, Redux-toolkit and Sass, I decided to make some meaningful project that will include almost all the knowledge I have gathered so far. 
I created a website with ReactJS where the client can change the content, i.e. update the products. 
The main activities of this website are the sale of antiques and the manufacture and repair of jewelry. 
The project consists of four pages that are accessible to users and three pages that are accessible only to the client/administrator. 
Each page has a fixed header and footer and another additional footer with links when scrolled to the end. 
I used Firebase for authentication and database. 
The client must log in, and that's the only way he can access the admin pages and update the products. 
After it is registered, it can manage products, i.e. execute crud actions. 
If it is logged in, it does not have to be logged in again if the data is saved in the session. 
The user can view the offer on the sales page and search by product name or filter by category. 
Most of the logic takes place via the Redux-toolkit. 
On the contact page there is a form for sending emails that works using the EmailJS service. 
I used motion-framer for the animations, and I made some animations from scratch, such as the button and image slider. 
Some of the dependencies I used are (reduxjs/toolkit, antd, firebase, framer-motion, react-icons, react-router-dom, sass, emailjs-com). 
For image processing, for example, the logo, I used Pixlr, something like PhotoShop.
Everything is responsive and adapted for all devices. 
The page is located on the Hostinger server and the domain is from carnet calviantique.hr.
